# ASL Recognition with Deep Learning.

It is a Python based conventional neural network that classifies images of letters from Americal sign language. With the help of Tensorflow and Keras, 
to examine, recognize and then train the artifical network to recognize images. Project includes the use of image processing, convolution, maxpooling. 
Explore the project in detail in the notebook.
